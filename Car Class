//1. A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behaviors that objects created from the class will have. 

//2. When you pass an object to a print or println method invokes the toString() method of the object to obtain a string representation of it. 

//3. In a method The scope of a variable declared within a method is limited to that method. It cannot be accessed outside the method and is created when the method is called and destroyed when it exits. variables declared in a class can have broader scopes.
